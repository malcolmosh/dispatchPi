# DispatchPi
## A connected and efficient e-paper picture frame

There are two folders to browse here:

- **Screen** contains the code found on the Raspberry Pi device
- **Server** holds the code hosted online in a dockerized Flask app 

To replicate this project, you will most likely need : 

- A raspberry pi and a e-paper screen
- A Google Developer account
- A Gmail API key
- A Flask app to host on Google Cloud Run
- A love for trial and error! 
- An inclination to tinker with electronics and tiny screws (@$&!****)
